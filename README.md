This is a code for a microcontroller called STM32 more spefically a simple code for a push button, buzzer, and a LED using Digital pins (wow i sound so cool :3 ) 
thats basically it schematics are pretty straight forward from a0 to a2 go to their respective components in the code and each component needs a wire to ground to complete the circuit
